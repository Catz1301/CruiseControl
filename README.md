# CruiseControl
A script for GTAIV providing cruise control functionality.

## Requirements:
+ GTA IV (Obviously)
+ ScriptHookDotNet.asi
+ An ASI Loader
Download links are under the [Resourses](#resources) section.

## Controls
Currently, there is only one keybinding for enabling/disabling cruise control: LCTRL + LSHIFT + C.
There is also a config reload command for the game console: 'reloadCruiseControlConfig', and 'reloadCCConfig'. They both do the same thing.
